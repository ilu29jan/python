A module id a collection of functions, data members and class names
ex - math ---------->pow(), sin(), cos(), tan(), sinh(), cosh(), tanh(), factorial()
here math is module and those are the functions

Data members -- those are present inside match module like PI-3.14 (pie), E=2.71
import math
print(math.pi)  --out ->3.14
print(math.e)   --out ->2.718

Arrays means collection of homogenious values or similar values.
If i have written int a[100] out of which 10 values are getting used and 90 are unused. 
so to eliminate these 90 unused memory space we use garbage collector which is inbuilt solution of python. By this performance will be also good.
So python says if you have allocated 100 values out of which 10 values are getting used so rest of the 90 locations automatically get eliminated. 
this mechanism is called Garbage collector. ( release unused memory space )
Garbage collector collects un-used memory space and improves the performance of python based applications.
A garbage collector is one of the in-built python backgroud program, which is running along with regular python program and whose role is to collect 
unused memory space and inproves the perforamance of python based application.
Hence in python programming automatic memory management taken care by garbage collector
