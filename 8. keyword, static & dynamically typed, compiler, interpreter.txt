what is a keyword
It is a reserved word in the lang which will give some specific meaning to the lang compilers.

import keywork as k
print(k.kwlist) ------ it will print the list of keywords
len(k.kwlist)  ----- 35

In python there is no need to declare data types. It is dynamic also. But on c, c++, java we have declare the data type name.
for ex in java int a = 10 here we are declaring int data type but for python simply a=10 it will accept. In java it is static and in python it is dynamic.
that means if we decalre a=10 then after that we can declare a=10.75 it will not throw any error. 
python environment automatically defines the data type. No need to worry about the value that under which data type we have to declare that.


we have 2 types of languages
- static typed programming languages
- Dynamically typed programming languages

In static typed , It is mandatory to use data types along with variable names ( variable declaration )
otherwise we get compile time error
ex - 
int a,b,c ; // variable declaration mandatory
a=10;
b=20;
c=a+b
the above is done in c,c++,java, c#.net etc

In Dynamically typed programmers will not assign any data types.Internally language execution environment will assign the data type automatically or implicitly
based on type of value programmers uses/assign.
ex - 
a=10
b=2.2
c=a+b
print(a,type(a)) ------- 10<class 'init'>
print(b,type(b)) ------- 2.2<class 'float'>
print(c,type(c)) ------- 12.2<class 'float'>
the above is done in python. here we have not declared any data type, python env does that


Interpretation  ------ line by line conversion is called interpretation
Interpreter     -------- the software that will do the conversion is called Interpreter

Compilation ------ All in one conversion process is called compilation ( reading the source lines and converting all it once to destination )
compliler  -------- Compiler does the above process 

Example of above -
If a politician came from delhi to hyderabad to give a speech to people. Here politician speak in hindi but audiance is telugu. So in middle someone is 
required to convert the language from hindi to telugu that is known as translater and technically it is called as Interpreter. He coverts the speech line by
line which is called as Interpretation.
Same thing while it comes out on newspaper the other day it will convert all the speech into paragraphs at a time it is called as compilation.

In C prog language execution environment supoose we a have file name as sum.c where c is the extension for c lang file. Inside the file we have lot many lines
of code which is called as source code. The compilation phase will start where compiler will compile the all the line of source code at once and convert it
into object code or intermediate code. Then that file name will be sum.obj. In the compilation phase it's generally checks for any syntax errors.
Then comes the execution phase , Here C-shell is a software which executes the program, C-shell reads entire object code and converts it into machine 
understandable code( binary code) which is understandable by OS and processor and finally gives result.
So it's like Source code to Object code then Object code to Binary Code this is how C program will execute.

Same as above the process is same in Python
Sum.py ( Source code ) get converts to object code/Intermidiate code by using python compiler But here in python compiler it is unique compare to other
lang. Here it converts the source code in LINE by LINE, So python compiler here acts as interpreter. Suppose i have 20 errors in code but it will throw 
error for the 1st error first. It won't show all the errors at a time. It will check line by line if any error come then it will throw the error there itself.
In python and java the intermidiate code is called as byte code not object code as in C. ".pyc" is an extension of byte code. pyc is called as python compiled
version.
So python compiler compiles the source code converts it to byte code into .pyc extension. Then comes the execution phase. PVM will do the execution. PVM 
stands for python virtual machine. PVM understands byte code and generates binary code. Role of PVM is it reads line by line of byte code and converted into machine understandable code ( Binary code or machine code).
and it is understandable by OS and processor and finally gives result.
Though complilation and execution happens line by line so python program is called as Interpreted based programming language.

				4. Interpreted Programming
	      	===============================================
=>When we develop any python program, we must give some file name with an extension .py (File Name.py).
=>When we execute python program, two process taken place internally
		a) Compilation Process
		b) Execution Process.
=>In COMPILATION PROCESS, The python Source Code submitted to Python Compiler and It reads the source Code, Check for errors by verifying syntaxes and if no errors found then Python Compiler Converts into Intermediate Code called BYTE CODE with an extension .pyc (FileName.pyc). If erros found in source code  then we get error displyed on the console.
=>In EXECUTION PROCESS, The PVM reads the Python Intermediate Code(Byte Code) Line by Line and Converted into Machine Understable Code (Executable or binary Code) and It is read by OS and Processer and finally Gives Result.
=>Hence In Python Program execution, Compilation Process and Execution Process is taking place Line by Line conversion and  It is one of the Interpretation Based Programming Language.

Definition of PVM ( Python Virtual Machine )
--------------------------------------------------------------------
=>PVM is one program in Python Software and whose role is to read LINE by LINE of Byte Code and Converted into Machine Understable Code (Executable or binary Code)
