                       BASE CONVERSION FUNCTIONS IN PYTHON

- The process of converting one number system into another number system value is called base conversion.
- In python programming we have 3 base conversion functions. They are 
  * bin()
  * oct()
  * hex()

1. bin()
- syntax varname=bin(Decimal / Octal / HexaDecimal value)   
This function is used converting any number system value into Binary.
example-
>>> bin(0o542)       --- conversion of Octal to binary
'0b101100010'
>>> bin(0xbd34)      --- conversion of hexa to binary
'0b1011110100110100'
>>> bin(23)          --- conversion of Decimal to binary
'0b10111'

2. oct()
- syntax varname=oct(Decimal / Binary / HexaDecimal value)   
This function is used converting any number system value into Octal.
example-
>>> oct(15)          --- conversion of Decimal to Octal
'0o17'
>>> oct(0b1011)      --- conversion of Binary to Octal
'0o13'
>>> oct(0x54ad)      --- conversion of Hexadecimal to Octal
'0o52255'

3. hex()
- syntax varname=hex(Decimal / Binary / Octal value)   
This function is used converting any number system value into hex.
Example-
>>> hex(56)          --- conversion of Decimal to hexa
'0x38'
>>> hex(0b1010)       --- conversion of Binary to hexa
'0xa'
>>> hex(0o437)       --- conversion of Octal to hexa
'0x11f'
