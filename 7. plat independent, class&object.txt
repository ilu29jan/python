If we want to just execute the program then we can use primary memory (RAM) which is temporary and if we want to store the data then we can use secondary 
memory such as Oracle, mysql..

There are 14 types of data types
- int
- float
- bool
- complex

- str
- bytes
- bytearray
- range

- list
- tuple

- set
- frozenset

-dict

-NoteType

Data types allocates sufficient amount of memory space for storing inputs in main memory(RAM).

- In C,C++ lang data types takes different memory spaces on different OS and hence these lang are called "platform dependent lang".
  for example int takes 2 bytes on DOS and 4 bytes on unix, float takes 4 bytes DP on DOS and 8 bytes DB on unix...

- In java lang data types takes same memory spaces on different OS  and hence this lang is called "platform independent lang"
  for example int takes 2 bytes on DOS and 1 bytes on unix, float takes 4 bytes on DOS and 8 bytes on unix...
- BUT All the data types (pre-defined data types) are not able to store large volume of data due to memory space restrictions 
  ex- int a=99999999999999999999999999999999999 ------------- (invalid) it will throw error "integer number too large"  (PYTHON WILL RUN WITHOUT ERROR HERE)
- data types are unable to store multiple values
  ex- int k =10,"ilu",34.23,"kd"  -------- invalid due to multiple values
- In java programming, we can define programmer-defined data types by using classes and object.
- In java programming, objects stores multiple values but the java objects are size restricted.

In python it resolves all above problems that are there in c,c++ and java
python stores in data in the form of objects. I can define any large number of data , i can define multiple data in a single variable 
for example k =10,"ilu",34.23,"kd" it will easily print this.

what is a class and object
suppose you want to build a house and we have money and land, now what is required plan/design, then will contanct architecture.
then he gave a diagram of all dimensions of house for rooms and all.then will give that design to builder. he will take some months. Now all the things we 
will keep it in a house which is called an Object. where i am storing the data is called object.And design is called class (specification of house). Another person like my plan they are also they will 
build another house. Like this by using a single plan multiple house will get build. 
Object is storing the data so it is having memory space and class doesn't have any memory space. 
So which ever thing utilize memory space are known as objects and the things that dont utilize space are class
In objects of python doen't have size restrictions
