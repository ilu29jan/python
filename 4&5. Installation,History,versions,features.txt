features of python programming
- features are nothing but services or facilities provided by language developers in the languages and they are used by language programmers for developing 
  real time applications.

  5. High level
  6. Freeware and opensource
  7. Robust ( means strong)
  8. Extensible
  9. Embedded
 10. Both functional and object oriented programming lang
 11. Supports third party API's or modules such as Numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy, scikit, seaborn, nltp... etc

Rich set of modules are available which are also called as LIBRARIES.Library means pre defined code that we are using for our development

import math
print(math.factorial(4))   ---output -> 24 (4*3*2*1)
print(math.sqrt(25))   -- opt -> 5  ( This library is used on normal math) ( now for -25 square root we need to use cmath library )

import cmath
print(cmath.sqrt(-25))  -- opt -> 5j

import random
print(random.randint(1000,10000)    --- output will be some random numbers between 1000 to 10000. Used for OTP's
